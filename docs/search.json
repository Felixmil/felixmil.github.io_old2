My role wasn’t clear at the begining, so I sticked to what I knew and started bibliography to find relevant clinical applications. I identified one main clinical area where this new assay could be useful: Trauma management. With that, a wide set of variables that I identified as the most promising ones. An impression grew bigger and bigger as I was pursuing this designing phase: I didn’t have the right toolbox to manage all that data efficiently.\n            I broke my elbow and found myself home for one month: still with that impression in mind, I was determined to get back on those SQL basics I learned in Bioinformatics class.
